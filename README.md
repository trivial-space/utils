# Trivial space utils

Utility helpers and functions used throughout the trivial space projects.
Unlike the trivial space libs, this project has external dependencies.

_This library is fluctuating a lot, changed and updated as the rest of the trivial space projects evolves. Do not use for production applications!_

Developed and build for usage with TypeScript. Compiled for tree shaking with webpack or rollup.
